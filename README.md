# IMBD Jr. 


## Introduction 

IMDB Jr. is the little sibling of the [Internet Movie Database (IMDB)](https://www.imdb.com). 
It's an easy-to-use web application, powered by PHP. We interface this front-end
with a MySQL server, which holds all of the movie information.

All rights are currently strictly reserved to us, as the project is still in-progress. 

Built for CS 143 during the Fall 2015 quarter at UCLA.
